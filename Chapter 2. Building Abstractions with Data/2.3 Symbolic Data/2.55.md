 ;; (car ''something) is treated by the interpreter as: 
 ;; (car (quote (quote something))) 
 ;; The first occurrence of 'quote' quotes the next entity 
 ;; (quote something),which is actually a list with two elements, so 
 ;; caring this list yields 'quote. However, this is just a quoted 
 ;; symbol, not a procedure, typing quote in the interpreter prints: 
  
 quote 
  
 ;; =>(#@keyword . #<primitive-macro! #<primitive-procedure quote>>) 
 ;; whereas typing 'quote just yielded it literally.
